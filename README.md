# MarsPhotos App
==================================

Introduction
------------

MarsPhotos is a demo app that shows actual images of Mars's surface. These images are
real-life photos from Mars captured by NASA's Mars rovers. The data is stored on a Web server
as a REST web service.

## Built With ðŸ› 
----------------

 - **Kotlin** - First class and official programming language for Android development.
 - **Coroutines** - For asynchronous and more.
 - **Android Architecture Components** - Collection of libraries that help you design robust, testable, and maintainable apps.
    - **LiveData** - Data objects that notify views when the underlying database changes.
    - **ViewModel** - Stores UI-related data that isn't destroyed on UI changes.
    - **ViewBinding** - Generates a binding class for each XML layout file present in that module and allows you to more easily write code that interacts with views.
 - The app will demonstrate the use of [Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/) to make REST requests to the web service, [Moshi](https://github.com/square/moshi) to
handle the deserialization of the returned JSON to Kotlin data objects, and [Coil](https://coil-kt.github.io/coil/) to load images by URL.
